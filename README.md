# AMRseq
AMRseq - Whole genomic sequencing of Bacterial pathogen for unravelling anti-microbial resistent (AMR) genetc traits derived from clinical isolates


AMRseq is currently using two different next-generation sequencing technologies

### a. Illumina - https://github.com/drabhishekkumar/AMRseq/blob/main/AMRseq_Illumina_Pipeline.md

### b. Nanopore - https://github.com/drabhishekkumar/AMRseq/blob/main/AMRseq_ONT_Pipeline.md
